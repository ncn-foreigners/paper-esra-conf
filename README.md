# Repository with codes for paper:
### "`singleRcapture`: an R package for estimation of population size using single-source capture-recapture models"

Raw data file with .rds extension as well as fitted final models use in the
publication are in the data folder.

The code used to obtain results (model selection data cleaning regression 
fitting) is in Code.R file and requires [`singleRcapture`](https://ncn-foreigners.github.io/singleRcapture/) 
package. At the time of writing the paper we used the pre-release of `0.1.4` 
version of the package but the code now uses the current version of 
`singleRcapture` which should not cause any major changes. 
The computations were done using R version: `4.1.2`.

Rootogram included in the paper is in [Rootogram_esra_2.pdf](https://github.com/ncn-foreigners/paper-esra-conf/blob/main/Rootogram_esra_2.pdf) file

The paper itself is in Paper.pdf file.
